# advanced-css-portfolio
The repo for the second UMN WebDev Bootcamp project, which demonstrates advanced CSS


This is meant to be a place where I can list my basic portfolio stuffers. I plan on coming back here over time and adding projects as I make them. I also plan on revisiting the CSS and continuing to polish this project. 

This project itself showcases responsive design, advanced layout, and resource navigation.
